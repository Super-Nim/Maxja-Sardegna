# Maxja Dapp

The Dapp is more than just an NFT minter. It provides a guided experience from onboarding the user, to purchasing crypto from their bank card, 
to minting their NFT ticket - and FINALLY viewing their ticket as proof of ownership in the Dapp.

The Dapp enables a smooth transition from web 2 to web 3 thanks to familiar username/email registration and the fiat on-ramper. 

However, it wouldn't be a Dapp without a Wallet! The user must have **MetaMask installed** otherwise the app will prompt them to do so.

## Home (desktop)

The Home page outlined the Dapp's user flow and is only visible once the user registers their details and connects their MetaMask wallet.

## Buy Crypto (mobile)

The page enabled users to purchase Matic and USDC on the Polygon network.
