# Maxja-Sardegna

## Project Aim

This is a Live NFT Minter for the Maxja Festival in 2022, hosted here: [lucky-sun-8549.on.fleek.co](https://lucky-sun-8549.on.fleek.co/) 

The public website explains the festival and the relevance of the Dapp.

The Dapp has a specific user flow, highlighted in the toolbar itself:

1. The User registers their name and email for the Mandala NFT airdrop
2. If the user does NOT own any crypto, they can purchase Polygon versions of MATIC and USDC via the On-Ramper
3. The registered user can approve the $167 USDC to be spent on the minter contract's behalf and mint their ticket!
4. Once verified on-chain, the NFT's are viewable - this includes ALL Polygon NFTs.
